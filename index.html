    <h1 class="bangers-regular">ARE MEN UNDER ATTACK?</h1>
    <h2 class="bangers-regular">A website exploring the myths around men</h2>
    <p>Manosphere content is filled with emotional buzzwords: <br><span class="bangers-regular grad1">ALPHA!</span>, <span class="bangers-regular grad2"> SIMP!</span>, <span class="bangers-regular grad3"> WOKE!</span>, <span class="bangers-regular grad4"> CUCK!</span>, <span class="bangers-regular grad2"> FEMINAZI!</span><br> 
    These words make you react instead of reflect.</p>

        <h3 class="bangers-regular">AM I THINKING CRITICALLY?</h2>
            <p>Critical thinking is about being aware that not everything you read is true: it's a skill you can develop, not something people are born with.</p>
            <p>When you read content online, it can be helpful to ask yourself:</p>
            <ul> Is this actually true, or just someone’s opinion that feels true?</ul>
            <ul>What emotions does this trigger in me?</ul>
            <ul>Who benefits from me thinking this way? Is this making somebody else rich or successful?</ul>
            <ul>What kind of evidence would disprove this idea, and have I looked for it?</ul>
            <ul>Are there emotional buzzwords used?</ul>
            <ul>Is this content trying to manipulate my opinion?</ul>
    </div>
    <p>Online, it’s easy to feel like you’re getting the full picture, while you are actually only hearing the same opinions repeated back at you. 
        This is because <a href="#" class="overlay-trigger" data-overlay-id="overlay1">algorithms</a> feed you more of what you already like and agree with. Over time, this creates what we call an 
        <a href="#" class="overlay-trigger" data-overlay-id="overlay2">Echo Chamber</a> -  a space where you predominantly see ideas that confirm your already existing opinions. That can make certain beliefs feel way more ‘true’ or normal than they actually are. And when you’re only hearing one side, things start to feel black-and -white. People become ‘good’ or ‘bad’ and complex problems are reduced to simple dichotomies. 

        This is what we see happening in certain online communities, for example ones that relate to ‘the manosphere’. The messages that are spread on these platforms are often driven by emotion, rather than reason. 
        
        That’s concerning and has real-world consequences. It can lead to a confirmation bias and, over time, refusal to engage with opposite opinions. This leads to polarization, extremism and neotribalism.</p>

        <h3>ALGORITHM</h3>
      <p>An algorithm is like a digital recommendation system. It works by tracking what you click on, like, share, or watch for a long time, and then gives you more of that. So, lets say you click on one video about “alpha males” or “dating tips,” the algorithm concludes you want more of that and thus shows you similar content.
